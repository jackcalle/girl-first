# Girls First Digital Studio
## Variable - A storage of a value (number, words, etc)
- Think of a variable like an envelope it holds anything you put inside of it.

## Types of Variables - What specific type of values the variable can store.
- Int - Stores integers (whole number negative and positive).
    * public int year = 365;
-  Boolean - Stores true or false values.
    * public bool hired = true;
-  Float - Stores decimal numbers.
    * public float speed = .5f;

# CubeMove C# Script

```
	using UnityEngine;
	using System.Collections;

	public class CubeMove : MonoBehaviour {
	public float speed = .5f;
	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
	
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {

		if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.W)){
			transform.position += new Vector3 (0, 0, speed);
		}
		if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.S)){
			transform.position += new Vector3 (0, 0, -speed);
		}
		if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A)){
			transform.position += new Vector3 (-speed, 0, 0);
		}
		if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.D)){
			transform.position += new Vector3 (speed, 0, 0);
			}
		}
	}
```






# Enemy C# script

```
	using UnityEngine;
	using System.Collections;
	using UnityEngine.UI;

	public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour {
	public Text text;
	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		if (CubeMove.lives == 0) {
			text.enabled = true;
		}
	}
	void OnTriggerEnter(Collider obj){
		CubeMove.lives -= 1;
		Destroy (obj.gameObject);
		Application.LoadLevel(0);
		}
	}
```

#WinZone C# script

```
	using UnityEngine;
	using System.Collections;

	public class WinZone : MonoBehaviour {

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
	
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
	
	}

	void OnTriggerEnter(Collider obj){
		Destroy (obj.gameObject);
		}
	}
```


## Week 3: June 25
- Review from last week
- Update CubeMove and Enemy scripts by adding variables speed and lives
- Application.LoadLevel--reloading the game/level
- Learning to use Build Settings
- Learning to use Unity API
- Tagging the cube--“player”
- Adding Canvas and text to game
- Adding color to object/Creating Materials/Assets folder

# Updated CubeMove Script

```
	using UnityEngine;
	using System.Collections;

	public class CubeMove : MonoBehaviour {
	public float speed = .5f;
	public static int lives=3;
	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
	
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {

		if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.W)){
			transform.position += new Vector3 (0, 0, speed);
		}
		if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.S)){
			transform.position += new Vector3 (0, 0, -speed);
		}
		if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A)){
			transform.position += new Vector3 (-speed, 0, 0);
		}
		if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.D)){
			transform.position += new Vector3 (speed, 0, 0);
			}
		}
	}
```

(Using the variable Speed it’s able to change the speed of the controls. Lives is also created to keep track of how many lives are in the game at that moment.)

# Lives Script for Enemy Script

```
	using UnityEngine;
	using System.Collections;

	public class CubeMove : MonoBehavior {
	public float speed = .5f;
	public static int lives=3;
  	// Use this for initialization 
	void Start (){
	}
```

(The 5th line tells it to subtract one from the variable lives when the player collides with the enemy)

```
    void Update () {
	}
        void OnTriggerEnter(Collider obj){
               Destroy (obj.gameObject);
               Application.LoadLevel("Game");
	}
```
	
(This belongs on the Enemy script and makes it reset the level when you touch (collide) the player object with the enemy object.)

#Week 4: July 2 
- Reviewing CubeMove, Enemy, and WinZone scripts
- Making the text “Game Over!” appear when the lives count reached 0.
- Adding images to objects
- Creating a pick-up system (using the Enemy script) with coins and other collectables
- Understanding how to read the Console and fix errors in code



# Week 5: July 16 
- Rotating the object 45 degrees when it touched the wall
- Using Blender 3D Model Repository to upload 3D Models into Unity
- Parenting the 3D Model to the AI cube into order to place the 3D model on top of the cube
- Using Mesh Renderer to make the cube invisible and make only the 3D model visible
- Creating background using Google Images (e.g. sand and water)
- Creating an object that chases the original object

# AIController Script:
```
	using UnityEngine;
	using System.Collections;

  	public class AIController : MonoBehaviour {
	public float speed = 2.0f;
		// Use this for initialization
		void Start () {
		}
		// Update is called once per frame
		void Update () {
		     transform.Translate (Vector3.forward * Time.deltaTime * speed);
	  	}
	}
```	
# WallController Script:

```
	using UnityEngine;
	using System.Collections;

	public class WallController : MonoBehaviour {
	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
	}
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
	}
	void OnTriggerEnter(Collider obj) {
		if (obj.tag == "AI") {
			transform.Rotate (new Vector3 (0, 180, 0));
			transform.Rotate (new Vector3 (0, 45, 0));
			}
		}
	}
```

# Week 6: July 23 
- Based on a set of rules: the students completed a game that was required to have:
      * An AI controller object that moved on its own
      * CubeMove, Enemy, WinZone Scripts
      * A rotation once the object touched the wall
      * An object that chased the other object
      * A 3D model parented to the AI Controller
      * An object that the player can control (with the keys--W, A, S, D)
      * Preface to publishing game on Itch.io
